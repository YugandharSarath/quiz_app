## ‚ùì Quiz App Specification

### üß† Goal

Create an interactive quiz where users answer **multiple-choice questions (MCQs) one by one**, get their **final score**, and can **restart** the quiz.
---

### ‚úÖ Features (Explained)

- **One question at a time**
  The quiz displays only a single question on the screen. Users must answer the current question to move to the next. This ensures a focused and clean interface.

- **Options shown as radio buttons**
  Each question has multiple options displayed as radio buttons. The user can select only **one** option per question.

- **Final score display after last question**
  Once the user has answered all questions, the app displays a summary showing the total number of correct answers out of the total number of questions.

- **"Play Again" resets the entire quiz**
  A "Restart" or "Play Again" button appears after the quiz ends. Clicking it will reset:

  - The current question index back to 0
  - The score to 0
  - All selected answers

- **Prevents submission if no option is selected**
  Users cannot move to the next question or submit an answer unless they have selected an option. This ensures intentional participation and prevents accidental clicks.

### üìö Edge Case Handling

- If **no questions** are available in the data set, show a message like:
  _‚ÄúNo quiz available‚Äù_

- If the user **tries to submit without selecting any option**, show a warning and block progression.

- When the user clicks **‚ÄúPlay Again‚Äù**, all quiz states (score, selected answers, current question) should be reset.

- Ensure **radio buttons** allow only one option to be selected at a time.

- The **third option (Option C)** should use `data-testid="option-C"`.
- The **fourth option (Option D)** should use `data-testid="option-D"`.
