# Quiz App â€“ Solution Breakdown

This app allows users to attempt a series of 5 quiz questions with 4 options each. Hereâ€™s how the solution is structured:

---

## âœ… Components Summary

### `App.tsx`
- Maintains the core state:
  - `currentQuestionIndex`, `selectedOption`, `score`, `quizEnd`
- Handles:
  - Option change (`handleOptionChange`)
  - Submit answer (`handleSubmit`)
  - Restart quiz (`resetQuiz`)
- Conditional rendering for Question or Score components.

---

### `Question.tsx`
- Displays question ID and text
- Renders `Options.tsx` with current choices
- Wraps everything in a form to handle submission

---

### `Options.tsx`
- Maps over options
- Uses radio inputs
- Binds `onChange` and sets `checked` for selected answer

---

### `Score.tsx`
- Shows score summary
- Offers a button to restart the quiz

---

## ðŸ’¡ Design Decisions
- **Functional components** with TypeScript are chosen for clarity and simplicity.
- **Modular design** ensures separation of concerns.
- **Form submit handling** is used for clean state management per question.

---

## ðŸ”„ Flow
1. Start quiz â†’ Show 1st question
2. Select answer â†’ Submit â†’ Validate â†’ Move to next or end
3. Show final score â†’ Option to restart

This structure makes it easy to scale, maintain, or even enhance with features like:
